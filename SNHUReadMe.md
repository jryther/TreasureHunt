For this project I was tasked with developing the reinforced learning model of a pirate AI system that must traverse a maze to find a space occupied with a treasure chest.  I was provided with code for the pirate and the maze.  This project taught me how expansive computer science is.  This field is not only for the purpose of creating web apps but also has a lot of mathematical and scientific implications as well.  My goal is to go into web development as a career but I see the value in creating artificial intelligence models to solve problems that are relevant to the world today.  As a computer scientist, I have learned to approach problems in a specific way.  Looking at a project as a whole is too overwhelming and daunting.  By breaking it up into pieces I can focus on components that are much easier to solve and will ultimately end with me building or fixing the entire system.  My ethical responsibilities are to always consider the work that I am doing.  Just because I can do something doesnâ€™t mean that I should.  Designing systems can harm end users if not done correctly.  Privacy and bias concerns must be addressed and discussed before and during the software development lifecycle.
